I never tell you how much I miss you

Knowing it's all better left unsaid

Still mesmerized by renditions of

you in the back of my head

<br>

Wish I could grab you and pull you closer

Making up for the time we lost

Slow dancing in the kitchen in the early

hours of the morning

<br>

If I could get in a car and

Know I was closing in by the mile

Me and the highway

Maybe this time I'd stay for a while

Leaving the highway

Then falling asleep in your arms tonight

<br>

All my days I've been running away

I've been all about tomorrows

Here I go falling head over heels

In a dream of yesterday

I'm high and dry

Barely getting by

I'm so tired of always waiting

I miss the silliest things when you're far away

You're too far away

<br>

Do you remember our conversations

Hours of setting our minds at ease

God forbid someone else comes around

before I'm back in the city

There was a time when on lazy Sundays

I didn't mind being on my own

Now I have trouble remembering when

I ever felt so alone

<br>

If I could get in a car and

Know I was closing in by the mile

Me and the highway

Then falling asleep in your

arms tonight

<br>

All my days I've been running away

I've been all about tomorrows

Here I go falling head over heels

In a dream of yesterday

I'm high and dry

Barely getting by

I'm so tired of always waiting

I miss the silliest things when you're far away

You're too far away

<br>

I've got a feeling it might be the

once-in-a-lifetime-no-hesitation-

regrets-for-better-or-worse kind

No way around it

I've got everything to lose

So stay where you are

'Cause I'm coming for you

<br>

If I could get in a car and

Know I was closing in by the mile

Me and the highway

Maybe this time I'd stay for a while

Leaving the highway

Then falling asleep in your arms tonight

<br>

All my days I've been running away

I've been all about tomorrows

Here I go falling head over heels

In a dream of yesterday

I'm high and dry

Barely getting by

I'm so tired of always waiting

I miss the silliest things when you're far away

You're too far away
