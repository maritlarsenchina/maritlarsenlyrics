Now that I know who you are

I almost wish that I'd never met you

How incredibly sweet

This has proven to be

<br>

What if you don't even recognize

What in the world you are doing to me

Afraid of loving you right

Afraid of holding on tight

<br>

What if I froze in my tracks

Decided to turn without warning

Breaking my promises

Breaking your unknowing heart

Now that I know who you are

There's no way around it

You're too good for me

<br>

What if I'm weak when you need me the most

Loud when you need me listen closely

Oh, don't make no mistake

I might not have what it takes

<br>

Still now that I know who you are

How could I possibly find another

You, as good as you seem

You are my impossible dream

<br>

What if I froze in my tracks

Decided to turn without warning

Breaking my promises

Breaking your unknowing heart

Now that I know who you are

There's no way around it

You're too good for me

<br>

Now that I know who you are

I almost wish that I'd never met you

How incredibly sweet

This has proven to be

You put all your trust in me

And I'm yours, indefinitely

<br>

What if I froze in my tracks

Decided to turn without warning

Breaking my promises

Breaking your unknowing heart

Your unknowing, beautiful heart

Now that I've seen who you are

Afraid of letting you down

Like you've never been broken before

How can you ever be sure

There's no way around it
