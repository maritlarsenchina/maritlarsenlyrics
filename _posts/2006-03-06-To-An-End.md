A dream in a jar

A memory scar

Though trapped in a frame

Not one day the same

I fell and I weep

’til I’m too tired to sleep

And I ask permission to land

To strike up the band


Yet I’ll build and I’ll sow

I’ll watch ’til it grows

And I will take the chance

There’ll be no last dance


No when it arrives

The darkest of nights

Let me have my back turned

And not realise


The story’s coming to an end

I’ll never be just giving in

I’m living by the rolling dice

It’s closure but it’s in disguise



I try and I try (I will try so hard)

I’ll play with the fire (I circle around the fire because)

It goes unexplained (it goes unexplained)

I’m still in the game (I’m still in the game)

I’m scared to the bone (I’m scared to the bone)

I’m sitting at home (I’m sitting at home)

I prepared on the day (will bet on the day)

They’re ready for me



No when it arrives

The brightest of lights

Let me have my back turned

And not realise



The story’s coming to an end

I’ll never be just giving in

I’m living by the rolling dice

It’s closure but it sure feels nice
