Such a bad day for good weather

Right on time to miss the train

I just tied my shoes together

Dropped an earring down the drain

As the crowd goes rushing by

Suddenly he's right before my eyes

<br>

It's more than you're craving

It's staring you down

Turn around

Don't move 'til you believe it

It's you beyond saving

Feeling the pull

It's beautiful

Don't move

Don't move 'til you see it

<br>

In the green eyes of a stranger

Is someone I've known all along

There's safety in his danger

He's all of my unwritten songs

The platform fades and I go still

Face to face, I know I will

<br>

It's more than you're craving

It's staring you down

Turn around

Don't move 'til you believe it

It's you beyond saving

Feeling the pull

It's beautiful

Don't move, don't move

Don't move

Don't move 'til you see it

<br>

You gotta feel it to know

You gotta know it today

You gotta get with the flow

<br>

It's more than you're craving

It's staring you down

Turn around

Don't move 'til you believe it

It's you beyond saving

Feeling the pull

It's beautiful

Don't move, don't move

<br>

It's more than you're craving

It's staring you down

Turn around

Don't move 'til you believe it

<br>

It's you beyond saving

Feeling the pull

It's beautiful

Don't move, don't move

Don't move, don't move

Don't move

Don't move 'til you see it

<br>
