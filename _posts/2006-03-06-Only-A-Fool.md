So you say I need to consider this

Yours were the face that I couldn't resist

Yours was the fuel to the flames in my heart

Mine were the words that would tear us apart


Well I say I found the letters you wrote

Mine was the smile and the life that you broke

Mine was the story that you told your friends

Yours were the demons you couldn't defend


Understand me, as of lately I've learned a thing or two

There is just no way that I'll be coming home to you


'Cause only a fool would do this again

Only a fool would let you back in

There is no you left to embrace

There is no word would make it feel safe

Love was a gift, stubborn and wild

I was armed with the faith of a child

And you were my joy, you were my friend

There is no going back there again


It's more than you can ask of me my love

I'm coming out of nowhere

It feels good here better than you know

Isn't it only fair that you try and let it go?


Yours was the ring that I started to wear

Yours were the vows that went up in the air

Yours was the choice to stay away from her

Mine was the dream that got lost in the stir


These were the times I would call you my own

These were the times I were waiting at home

I'll tell you something, I've been changing after what you put me through

There is just no way that I'll be coming home to you


Cause only a fool would do this again

Only a fool would let you back in

There is no you left to embrace

There is no word would make it feel safe

Love was a gift, stubborn and wild

I was armed with the faith of a child

And you were my joy, you were my friend

There is no going back there again


'Cause only a fool would do this again

Only a fool would let you back in

There is no you left to embrace

There is no word would make it feel safe


It's more than you can ask of me my love

I'm coming out of nowhere

It feels good here better than you know

Isn't it only fair that you try and let it go?


Let it go

Let it go

I said "only a fool"

"Only a fool"
