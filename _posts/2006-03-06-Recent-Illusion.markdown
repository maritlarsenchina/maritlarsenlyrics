How hard can it be to

Have an to keep what everyone has?

Out walking the street

The beautiful meet

They're starting to laugh

I know too much

I've seen to much

I crave too much

I'm out of touch

My recent illusion

Blurred out my conclusion

There's no-one for me

I can't do it right

I can't sleep at night

He's all that I see

I want too much

I seek too much

I try too much

I'm out of touch

I feel too much

Demand too much

I lose too much

I've lost my butch

I aim high, you aim low

Oh, ain't that just the way it goes?

I see sparks, you see none

Had I only quit while it was fun
