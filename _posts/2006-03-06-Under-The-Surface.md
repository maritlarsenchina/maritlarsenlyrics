It’s such a funny sensation to be

so happy that you wanna die

Promises always were crazy to me

But never was I so surprised

Minutes are longer when we are apart

Your presence’s more than I can handle

It’s come to the point where I wonder if

I could ever be luckier

When suddenly I’m back at the core

Thinking of her who had you before

Were you as good

As good as we are

Do you remember?

Did you love her the way you love me?

Is there a chance that there might be

traces of her that you carry under the surface?

Lend me your ears, I would like to confess

I’m doubting that you can be real

By your side wearing a beautiful dress

I celebrate how good it feels

Say that you love me, say that it’s true

I know that I want to believe you

But somehow silence speaks louder than words

I’m worried she’s still on your mind

Suddenly I’m back at the core

Thinking of her who had you before

Were you as good

As good as we are

Do you remember?

Did you love her the way you love me?

Is there a chance that there might be

traces of her that you carry under the surface?

Mmm I know that I’m selfish

I know that it’s bad

I know, but it’s driving me mad

It’s driving me mad

Suddenly I’m back at the core

Thinking of her who had you before

Were you as good

As good as we are

Do you remember?

Did you love her the way you love me?

Is there a chance that there might be

traces of her that you carry under the surface?

under the surface

under the surface
