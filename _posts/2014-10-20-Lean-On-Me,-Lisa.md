When you feel like a story

without it’s last page

Feel like the morning,

too scared to break

Lean on me

Lean on me



When you feel a goodbye

on the tip of your tongue

You’re pulling the weight of the world

on your own

Lean on me

Lean on me, Lisa



Like a tree, like a rock,

like a tall mountain top

Like a dream, like a promise,

a sunny memory

Like a truth, like a song,

a place you call home

Lean on me, Lisa



When you’re wrapped in winter,

waiting for spring

When both feet are anchors,

you cant find your wings

Lean on me

Lean on me, Lisa



Like a tree, like a rock,

like a tall mountain top

Like a dream, like a promise,

a sunny memory

Like a truth, like a song,

a place you call home

Lean on me, Lisa



When you’re a ship lost at sea

When you drift away from me

Lean on me, Lisa

Lean on me, Lisa



Like a tree, like a rock,

like a tall mountain top

Like a dream, like a promise,

a sunny memory

Like a truth, like a song,

a place you call home

Lean on me, Lisa
