You say

We must move forward

And I say

Let's not go back

Once we were brave explorers

But this trail is a worn out track

 

Don't chase that setting sun

Look what we've become

 

Don't save me

I'll save you the hassle

Our little castle

Is a house of cards

This empty heartache's pending

This is us ending

 

You say You were just kidding

And I say This is no joke

We've grown and we're not fitting

We've flamed now to a wisp of smoke

 

Don't turn the truth around

It reads the same way upside down

 

Don't save me

I'll save you the hassle

Our little castle

Is a house of cards

This empty heartache's pending

This is us ending

so don't save me

don't you dare

 

Little by little

Sneaking upon

Until it's too much to ignore

Let's leave in the middle

Before a dead ends up down this road

Don't u dare

Leave me here

I'll go looking elsewhere

 

Don't save me

I'll save you the hassle

Our little castle

Is a house of cards

This empty heartache's pending

This is us ending

Don't save me

I'll save you the hassle

Our little castle

Is a house of cards

This empty heartache's pending

This is us ending

so don't save me

don't you dare
