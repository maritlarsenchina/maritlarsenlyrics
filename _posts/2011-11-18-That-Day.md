I'm pacing the streets

Where our story begins

On a pale autumn day

It was a day just like this

I'm back at the corner

Where you used to wait for me

Down by the place where we

Made our first memories

<br>

We smiled at each other

Your skin was so cold

And I swore I had never seen

you more beautiful

A few stolen glances

We stayed out in the rain

Could we just go back there again

<br>

To that day, that day

When I came to see

It was our time, our beginning

The end of the wait

Oh I wish I could go back to

where I was heading on

That day

<br>

I can't help but wonder

Every now and then

If I hadn't spoken

Would we have kept going

Your number is still here

On my fingertips

Like a forbidden secret

That shouldn't exist

<br>

I know that I loved you

I know that I tried

But the kind that will keep

you awake in the night

It just doesn't make sense

And time after time I was trying

to get back there again

<br>

To that day, that day

When I came to see

It was our time, our beginning

The end of the wait

Oh I wish I could go back to

where I was heading on

That day

<br>

I know that I loved you

I know that I tried

But the kind that will keep

you awake in the night

It just doesn't make sense

And time after time I was

trying to get back

Dying to get back there again

<br>

To that day, that day

When I came to see

It was our time, our beginning

The end of the wait

Oh I wish I could go back to

where I was heading on

That day

That day

When I came to see

<br>

where I was heading on

That day
