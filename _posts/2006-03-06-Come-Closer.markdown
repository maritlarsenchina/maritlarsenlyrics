Give me an invitation more than a guess

Give me a sign if only one single breath

I'll give you an empty page

This is the time and place

What kind of truth lives in the absence of trust?

What is the use of holding back on this much?

My eyes are open wide

Won't you let me inside?

Come closer, love

I can't hear what you're saying

Don't make it easy love

All the corners are fraying

How can I please you, love

When I don't know what you want?

It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?

I don't think so.

Uuh, how about you tell me what you're doubting us for?

What is wrong with both feet on this side of the door?

There is no easy way I'll be the one who stays

Come closer, love

I can't hear what you're saying

Don't make it easy love

All the corners are fraying

How can I please you, love

When I don't know what you want?

It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?

It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?

I don't think so.

You're so close to me

You're so far away

I don't know what you mean

You're way out of reach

You're so close to me

You're so far away

Come closer, love

I can't hear what you're saying

Don't make it easy love

All the corners are fraying

Won't you come closer, love

I can't hear what you're saying

How can I please you, love

When I don't know what you want?

It's a nice escape, but will it keep you warm at night?
