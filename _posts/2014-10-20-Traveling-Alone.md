You’re gonna get hungry

You’re gonna get tired

You’re gonna lose hope

Be wishing on stars

You’ve got to stay with it

<br />

You’re gonna get lost

You’re gonna get scared

You’re gonna wanna give up

Throw your hands in the air

But you gotta stay with it

Oh, you gotta stay with it

<br />

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone

You’re traveling alone

<br />

You're goona get lonely

You're goona get sad

It's gonna get messy

It's gonna look bad

But you gotta be in it

Oh, you gotta be in it

<br />

You’ve got to be patient

Admit when you’re wrong

You’ve got to keep singing

Singing your songs

You’ve got to be in it

Oh, you’ve got to be in it

<br />

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone

You’re traveling alone

<br />

You’re gonna keep learning

You’re gonna move on

You’re gonna keep trying

You’re gonna stay strong

You’re gonna get by

with a little help from your friends

But always remember

and never forget that

<br />

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone

<br />

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone

You’re traveling alone
