You’re gonna get hungry

You’re gonna get tired

You’re gonna lose hope

Be wishing on stars

You’ve got to stay with it



You’re gonna get lost

You’re gonna get scared

You’re gonna wanna give up

Throw your hands in the air

But you gotta stay with it

Oh, you gotta stay with it



You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone

You’re traveling alone



You're goona get lonely

You're goona get sad

It's gonna get messy

It's gonna look bad

But you gotta be in it

Oh, you gotta be in it



You’ve got to be patient

Admit when you’re wrong

You’ve got to keep singing

Singing your songs

You’ve got to be in it



You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone

You’re traveling alone



You’re gonna keep learning

You’re gonna move on

You’re gonna keep trying

You’re gonna stay strong

You’re gonna get by

with a little help from your friends

But always remember

and never forget that



You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone



You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

You are traveling alone

Like a rolling stone

You’re traveling alone
