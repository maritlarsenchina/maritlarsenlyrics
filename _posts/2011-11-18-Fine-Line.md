Show me the way and I'll follow you

Give me the book and I'll read it too

Give me a time and I'll sit and wait

<br>

Give me another weary fight

Give me one more of our endless nights

Give me something to hang on to

<br>

They say it's a fine line between love and hate

I'd rather be fighting than losing you, babe

You ran away with my favorite song

You think we're no good

I know that you're wrong

<br>

You know how it gets when I get mad

You should only believe the better half

of what's said

I can only imagine the damage done

<br>

If we were a record I could rewind

If I could go back and change my lines

I'd settle for being your friend today

<br>

They say it's a fine line between love and hate

I'd rather be fighting than losing you babe

You ran away with my favorite song

You think we're no good

I know that you're wrong

<br>

We may get lost along the way

But you and I have got what it takes

There's no denying a simple truth

Like I love you

<br>

They say it's a fine line between love and hate

I'd rather be fighting than losing you babe

You ran away with my favorite song

<br>

Oh, it's a fine line between love and hate

I'd rather be fighting than losing you, babe

It's a fine

It's a fine

It's a fine

It's a fine

It's a fine line between love and hate

You ran away with my favorite song
