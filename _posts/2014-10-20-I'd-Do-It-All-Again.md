Seventeen, big dreams

Wide awake, no sleep

Limelight, silver screens



Took a drive, head first

Like a bubble, I burst

Didn’t think 'til it hurt



I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go

I’ve been tried and true

Made a fool

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again



Twenty-four, a little more

Open heart, open doors

Never been so sure

As when I met him



Sold the truth, told a lie

Didn’t fight, never tried

Only held what was mine

What was I thinking



I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go

I’ve been tried and true

Made a fool

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again



Every sting, every scar

Every stop, every start

All the things that might have been

I would go back and do it all again



I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go



I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go

I’ve been tried and true

Made a fool

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again
