This is not a song about his lips

This is not another tender wish

That was then and these are different days

Even now, I sometimes miss the taste

<br />

This is not a song about a night

We were young and everything was right

When all the things we did just seemed to work

Now the news is old and

It all just seems to hurt, just seems to hurt

<br />

Don’t talk about what we are

Don’t talk about what we’ve been

What’s done is done

I don’t want to talk about it

<br />

It’s never just one mistake

It’s never just one heartbreak

What’s done is done

I don’t want to talk about it

<br />

This is not for all the tears we’ve cried

It’s not another worthless little fight

It all comes back to me but no regret

I’d rather let it go than just forget, just forget

<br />

Don’t talk about what we are

Don’t talk about what we’ve been

What’s done is done

I don’t want to talk about it

<br />

It’s never just one mistake

It’s never just one heartbreak

What’s done is done

I don’t want to talk about it

<br />

All of the good that remains

All that memory contains

All that is still unexplained

After he walked away

He is the reason

You are the reason why I

<br />

Don’t talk about what we are

Don’t talk about what we’ve been

What’s done is done

I don’t want to talk about it

<br />

It’s never just one mistake

It’s never just one heartbreak

What’s done is done

I don’t want to talk about it

<br />

Don’t talk about what we are

Don’t talk about what we’ve been

What’s done is done

Is done

Is done

I don’t want to talk about it

I don’t want to talk about it

Is done

Is done

I don’t want to talk about it

<br />

It’s never just one mistake

It’s never just one heartbreak

What’s done is done

I don’t want to talk about it
