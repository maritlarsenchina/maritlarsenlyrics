Late last night I saw you with that look in your eyes

You know the one you used to save for me

I tried to turn away, you put your arms around her

I swear it felt like my heart skipped a beat

<br>

You really have no idea

You really have no idea

What you're asking of me

What you're asking of me

<br>

Everyone keeps telling me it's for the better

I wish I didn't know it isn't true

You were the satellite, the moon,

the ever after

My best dress reminds me of you

<br>

You really have no idea

You really have no idea

What you're asking of me

What you're asking of me

I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write

<br>

I'm not gonna spend another minute

thinking, hoping that you might

No more second hand illusions

There is no you and me

I won't even consider there's a possibility

I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write

<br>

I'm not gonna ask around to see where

you'll be hanging around tonight

All the places you are going

The faces you will see

Well, maybe somewhere down the line

they'll lead you back to me

But I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write

<br>

I don't know what you put into the word forever

To me it means you don't just

change you mind

You were the one who'd softly

whisper leave me never

You used to say it to me all the time

<br>

You really have no idea

You really have no idea

What you're asking of me

What you're asking of me

I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write

<br>

I'm not gonna spend another minute

thinking, hoping that you might

No more second hand illusions

There is no you and me

I won't even consider there's

a possibility

I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write

<br>

I'm not gonna ask around to see where

you'll be hanging around tonight

All the places you are going

The faces you will see

Well, maybe somewhere down the line

they'll lead you back to me

But I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write

<br>

I'm not gonna write

But I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write

But I'm not gonna call

I'm not gonna write
