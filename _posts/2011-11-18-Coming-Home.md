I wonder if you know when you kiss me like that

You ruin me for anyone else

I wonder if you know that you've got me like that

You turn me back into myself

<br>

Do you know it's never been better

It's never been better

Do you know it's never been better

Than you

<br>

Are you thinking what I keep thinking

The most magical thing that I've known

One look in your eyes, I'm sinking

And it feels like coming home

It feels like coming home

<br>

Somehow I knew there'd be a reason to live

Through all of the maybe's and if's

That the broken dreams, hopes,

hearts, promises

Would lead to a moment like this

<br>

Do you know it's never been clearer

It's never been clearer

Do you know it's never been clearer

Than with you

<br>

Are you thinking what I keep thinking

The most magical thing that I've known

One look in your eyes, I'm sinking

And it feels like coming home

<br>

Are you dreaming like I keep dreaming

It's so bittersweet knowing alone

Are you falling like I've been falling

'Cos it feels like coming home

It feels like coming home

It feels like coming home

<br>

Feels like coming home

Feels like coming home

<br>

Do you know it's never been easier

It's never been easier

Do you know it's never been easier

Than with you

<br>

Are you thinking what I keep thinking

The most magical thing that I've known

One look in your eyes, I'm sinking

And it feels like coming home

<br>

Are you dreaming like I keep dreaming

It's so bittersweet knowing alone

Are you falling like I've been falling

'Cos it feels like coming home

<br>

Are you thinking what I keep thinking

Am I giving in on my own

Are you falling like I've been falling

'Cos it feels like coming home

Yeah, it feels like coming home

Yeah, it feels just like, just like

Yeah, it feels like coming home
