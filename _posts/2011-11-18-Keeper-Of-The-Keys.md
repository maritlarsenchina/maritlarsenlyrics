When you fall, when you fall,

when you fall into your silence

No way to touch, no way to reach, like

a bottled ship, no less

<br>

I wish I were the keeper of the keys

So I could help you out

Instead of breaking in

Oh Sweetheart

When the blues come marching in

Oh Sweetheart

Won’t you lean into my arms again

<br>

When you go, when you go,

when you go into your darkness

You’re safe inside your barricades,

your shining armor

But I’m tireless

<br>

I wish I were the keeper of the keys

So I could help you out

Instead of breaking in

Oh Sweetheart

When the blues come marching in

Oh Sweetheart

Won’t you lean into my arms again

<br>

When you fall, when you fall,

when you fall into your silence

No way to touch, no way to reach, like

a bottled ship, no less

<br>

I wish I were the keeper of the keys

So I could help you out

Instead of breaking in

Oh Sweetheart

When the blues come marching in

Oh Sweetheart

Won’t you lean into my arms again
