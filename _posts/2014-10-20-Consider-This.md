For all that is lost

For all that is cruel

For all that is new

Consider this

<br />

For all that is dark

For all that is here

For all that is true

Consider this

<br />

Before your mind’s made up

and all falls into place

Before your shoes are tied

and you go on your way

Before you give in to the danger of her kiss

Consider This

<br />

For all that is blue

For all that is has been

For all that’s enough

Consider this

<br />

For all that is frail

For all that is gone

For all that is love

Consider This

<br />

Before your mind’s made up

and all falls into place

Before your shoes are tied

and you go on your way

Before you give in to the danger of her kiss

Consider This

<br />

For all that is said

For all that is now

For all that will be

Consider me

Consider me
