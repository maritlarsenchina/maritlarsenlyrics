At first you don’t even notice

The second still undisturbed

Then suddenly out of nowhere

A crash and a universe



The echoes of faith and sience

Are battling for your trust

Are trying to break the silence

Arguing what comes first



Do you hold your breath and make up your mind

Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Which is gonna land the final blow

It’s a fight with

Faith and Sience



A moment that’s clear and honest

A word that moves all doubt

A flash of truth that blinds us

A theory that word it out

And I can’t forget about him

I can’t forget about him



Do you hold your breath and make up your mind

Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Which is gonna land the final blow

It’s a fight with

Faith and Sience

Faith and Sience



Do you hold your breath and make up your mind

Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Do you hold your breath and make up your mind



Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Which is gonna land the final blow

It’s a fight with

Faith and Sience

It’s a fight with

Faith and Sience
