At first you don’t even notice

The second still undisturbed

Then suddenly out of nowhere

A crash and a universe

<br />

The echoes of faith and science

Are battling for your trust

Are trying to break the silence

Arguing what comes first

<br />

Do you hold your breath and make up your mind

Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Which is gonna land the final blow

It’s a fight with

Faith and science

<br />

A moment that’s clear and honest

A word that moves all doubt

A flash of truth that blinds us

A theory that works it out

And I can’t forget about him

I can’t forget about him

<br />

Do you hold your breath and make up your mind

Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Which is gonna land the final blow

It’s a fight with

Faith and science

Faith and science

<br />

Do you hold your breath and make up your mind

Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Do you hold your breath and make up your mind

<br />

Can you calculate in space and time

Or is it just a feeling when you know

Which is gonna land the final blow

It’s a fight with

Faith and science

It’s a fight with

Faith and science
