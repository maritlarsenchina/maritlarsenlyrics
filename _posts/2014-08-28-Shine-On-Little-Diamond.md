Shine on

When your heart is tired

When your hands are cold

And your words are spent

<br />

Shine on

When you’re running dry

When the water’s deep

And your bones are bent

<br />

I’ve seen you in the dark and

I’ve seen you in the rough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough

<br />

Shine on

When you faith is weak

When you’re someone’s loss

And you’re out of love

<br />

Shine on

When the day is done

When the courtain’s closed

You’re giving up

<br />

I’ve seen you in the dark and

I’ve seen you in the rough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough

<br />

I’ve seen you in your struggle

I’ve seen your pain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain

<br />

Shine on you little diamond

Shine on you little diamond

Shine on you little diamond

<br />

When the clock runs out

And your bags are packed

When you’re all alone

And that’s all you have

Shine on

<br />

I’ve seen you in the dark and

I’ve seen you in the rough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough

<br />

I’ve seen you in your struggle

I’ve seen your pain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain
