Shine on

When your heart is tired

When your hands are cold

And your words are spent



Shine on

When you’re running dry

When the water’s deep

And your bones are bent



I’ve seen you in the dark and

I’ve seen you in the rough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough



Shine on

When you faith is weak

When you’re someone’s loss

And you’re out of love



Shine on

When the day is done

When the courtain’s closed

You’re giving up



I’ve seen you in the dark and

I’ve seen you in the rough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough



I’ve seen you in your struggle

I’ve seen your pain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain



Shine on you little diamond

Shine on you little diamond

Shine on you little diamond



When the clock runs out

And your bags are packed

When you’re all alone

And that’s all you have

Shine on



I’ve seen you in the dark and

I’ve seen you in the rough

Shine on you little diamond

You’re more than enough



I’ve seen you in your struggle

I’ve seen your pain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain

Shine on you little diamond

And nothing’s in vain
