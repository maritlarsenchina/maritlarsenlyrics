You give me this and leave me alone here


Do you presume the battle’s won?


I’ll keep my head above the water


‘til you admit the damage’s done


 


Dry shimmer dazzle afternoon


Your poison passion came too soon


You waste what you think you own


 


You cry when you’re still alone


I will not let you go destroy this


I won’t allow a broken promise


You give me this and leave me wondering


Am I supposed to put my faith in


Dry shimmer dazzle afternoon


Your poison passion came too soon


You waste what you think you own


You cry when you’re still alone


You cry when you’re still alone


You cry when you’re still alone
