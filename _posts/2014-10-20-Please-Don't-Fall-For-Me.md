Whenever you need someone to tell you

slow down on the drinks

Whenever you’ve had a little too much

Whenever you need an alibi for

all your wicked schemes

Or need an escape just because



And whether you’ve lost a job

or you’re just out of cigarettes

Whenever you’re stuck,

tell me what you need

I’ll be the cure for all your hurt,

but darling don’t forget

That whatever you do

Don’t fall for me



‘Cause if your heart is set on something

that is not supposed to be

If your eyes are looking for something

you’re not supposed to see

I’d rather turn around than turn you down

No matter how much I’d hate to leave

So whatever you do

Please don’t fall for me



Maybe I’m underestimating

everything we’ve got

Maybe I’m cruel

Maybe I’m not

Maybe I’m too afraid to take a risk

on something good

But if it was right

Maybe I would



’Cause if your heart is set on something

that is not supposed to be

If your eyes are looking for something

you’re not supposed to see

I’d rather turn around than turn you down

No matter how much I’d hate to leave

So whatever you do

Please don’t fall for me



If your heart is set on something

that is not supposed to be

If your eyes are looking for something

you’re not supposed to see

I’d rather turn around than turn you down

No matter how much I’d hate to leave

So whatever you do

Please don’t fall for me

Don’t fall for me

Whatever you do,

don’t fall for me

don’t fall for me
