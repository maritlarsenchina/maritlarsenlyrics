Seventeen, big dreams

Wide awake, no sleep

Limelight, silver screens

<br />

Took a drive, head first

Like a bubble, I burst

Didn’t think 'til it hurt

<br />

I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go

I’ve been tried and true

Made a fool

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again

<br />

Twenty-four, a little more

Open heart, open doors

Never been so sure

As when I met him

<br />

Sold the truth, told a lie

Didn’t fight, never tried

Only held what was mine

What was I thinking

<br />

I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go

I’ve been tried and true

Made a fool

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again

<br />

Every sting, every scar

Every stop, every start

All the things that might have been

I would go back and do it all again

<br />

I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go

<br />

I’ve been up so high

Been down so low

Been held on tight

I’ve been let go

I’ve been tried and true

Made a fool

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again

But I wouldn’t change anything

I would go back and do it all again
