Dive in with me


I’ve got dust on my feet


I’ve got guilt on my hands


I need to get myself a second chance


Dive in with me


I got mud to my knees


My partner in crime


Tell me have you got the time


I’m coming clean of jealousy and shame


I’ve come to play the sinking game


I’ve come to let my armour down


Come to let my armour down


We dive into disease we dive deep, deep down in the sea


Hold your breath with me and until I’m ready


We dive into devotion, through all of my emotions


You will not let me go ‘til you’re finished with me


Dive in with me


My eyes are heavy


I can’t come at peace


I can’t remember what I did


I’m coming clean of jealousy and shame


I’ve come to play the sinking game


I’ve come to let my armour down


Come to let my armour down


We dive into disease we dive deep, deep down in the sea


Hold your breath with me and until I’m ready


We dive into devotion, through all of my emotions


You will not let me go ‘til you’re finished with me


We dive into disease we dive deep, deep down in the sea


Hold your breath with me and until I’m ready


We dive into devotion, through all of my emotions


You will not let me go ‘til you’re finished with me


we dive
