It runs in your blood

It’s on your mind

Tucked in your skin

Is where you’ll find

That little light that mends your bones

You’ll feel it when the morning comes

<br />

And when that light reaches your heart

Slows every beat, hold every part

No need to speak

Nowhere to run

You’ll know it when the morning comes

<br />

And when the veil is stripped away

And reveals the silver lining

Oh, the hope

the rising sun

You’ll see it when the morning comes

<br />

With all your soul

And all your might

Keep your head straight

Eyes to the sky

Be all you can

Do what you want

You’ll hold it when the morning comes

<br />

And when the veil is stripped away

And reveals the silver lining

Oh, the hope

the rising sun

You’ll see it when the morning comes

<br />

When you find your truth

Then live it out

When you find your song

Go play it loud

The sweetest air

Will fill your lungs

You’ll breath it when the morning comes

<br />

And when the veil is stripped away

And reveals the silver lining

Oh, the hope

the rising sun

You’ll feel it when the morning comes

You’ll see it when the morning comes
