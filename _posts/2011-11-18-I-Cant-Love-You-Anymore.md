I remember what you said

Each and every line

On that early morning when

You'd made up your mind

<br>

I was standing next to you but

You were already gone

Like a whisper in the wind was

Calling for you in the dawn

Calling for you in the dawn

<br>

While you were busy dreaming

My life was moving on

Now it's not what you imagined

Now you're standing at my door

All this time you left me hanging

I can't love you anymore

<br>

I remember what I said

Each and every time

You questioned my confidence

Back when you were mine

Back when you were mine

<br>

While you were busy leaving

My heart was holding on

Now it's not what I imagined

Now you're standing at my door

All this time you left me hanging

I can't love you anymore

<br>

All this time we kept on changing

While you thought love would keep on waiting

You had your chance

You lost my patience

I can't love you anymore

<br>

I can't love you anymore
