Every step that you take is just step

Only keep moving on to the next

Every beat of your heart is holding back

Every piece, every part is in the past

<br />

Where do you turn

when what you’re running from

Is still beneath your skin

How do you learn to live the life you had

before you let him in

You can try and try

With all your might

But only time will tell

you how to find the one you were

Before you fell

Before you fell

<br />

Every line that you cross is just a line

A little more, a little less every time

You’re trying to fight the feeling that there

isn’t any reason for the rise when you fall

It’s hard to keep believing when you’ve felt

so sure and you were proven so wrong

<br />

Where do you turn

when what you’re running from

Is still beneath your skin

How do you learn to live the life you had

before you let him in

You can try and try

With all your might

But only time will tell

you how to find the one you were

Before you fell

<br />

Where do you turn

when what you’re running from

Is still beneath your skin

How do you learn to live the life you had

before you let him in

You can try and try

With all your might

But only time will tell

you how to find the one you were

Before you fell

Before you fell

Before you fell

Every line that you cross is just a line

Before you fell

A little more, a little less every time
