This is not a song about his lips
This is not another tender wish
That was then these were different days
Even now, I sometimes miss the taste
This is not a song about the night
We were young and everything was right
When all the things we did just seemed work
Now the news is old
It all just seems to hurt
just seems to hurt

Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done
is done
I don't want to talk about it

It's never just one mistake
It's never just one heart break
What's done
is done
I don't want to talk about it

This is not for all the tears we've cried
It's not another worthless little fight
It all comes back to me but no regrets
I'd rather let it go and just forget
Just forget

Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done
is done
I don't want to talk about it
It's never just one mistake
It's never just one heart break
What's done
is done
I don't want to talk about it

All of the good that remains
All that memory contains
All that is still on display
after he walked away
He is the reason
You were the reason why I

Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done
is done
I don't want to talk about it
It's never just one mistake
It's never just one heart break
What's done
is done
I don't want to talk about it

Don't talk about what we are
Don't talk about what we've been
What's done
is done
It's done
It's done
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about it
It's done
It's done
I don't want to talk about it

It's never just one mistake
It's never just one heart break
What's done
is done
I don't want to talk about it
