Have you ever seen her face

The way it lights up when he

walks into the room

He is everything I want

And all that she's got

But there's a way around it

All I'd have to do is break her heart

<br>

But no, I don't

No, I won't There's just no way

he's the one

And it's done

I bet she

<br>

Makes his coffee in the morning

They share umbrellas in the rain

He kisses her without a warning

I bet he'll marry her someday

Have you ever met a man you could love forever

Only to find that he's with

somebody better

<br>

Have you ever met that one

Who shuts your heart down and

he didn't even try

Then you picture every day for

the rest of your life

From the very moment you

notice the sparkle in his eye

<br>

But no, we don't

No, we won't

Cause there's no we

She's the one

And it's done

I bet she

<br>

Makes his coffee in the morning

They share umbrellas in the rain

He kisses her without a warning

I bet he'll marry her someday

Have you ever met a man you could love forever

Only to find that he's with somebody better

<br>

All I'd have to do is break her heart

her heart

All I'd have to do is break her heart

her heart

But no, we don't

No, we won't

<br>

If only

he'd pull me out on to the sidewalk

And they were never meant to be

We'd get out of here together and

He would fall in love with me

But she

Makes his coffee in the morning

They share umbrellas in the rain

He kisses her without a warning

I bet he'll marry her someday

Have you ever met a man

you could love forever

Only to find that he's with

somebody better

<br>

Have you ever met a man

you could love forever

Only to find that he's with

somebody better
